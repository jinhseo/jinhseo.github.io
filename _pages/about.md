Hello:wave:, I am currently research intern at KIST, working on machine learning and computer vision.  

My research goal is to enable machine to learn and understand the world like human.  
It leads me to think about follow-up researches:  
1. Label-efficient learning
2. Learning from noisy labels
3. Depth estimation and 3D scene understanding

<!---My research topics focus on visual recognition techniques with data- and label-efficient approach.
I am also interested in learning from noisy data and 3D object recognition for robotics.
It leads me to think about follow-up research directions: 1. Learning from noisy labels 2. Perceptual intelligence for robotics.-->
