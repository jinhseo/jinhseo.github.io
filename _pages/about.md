Hello:wave:, I am a 2nd-yaer Ph.D student in School of Computing at KAIST, advised by Professor Sung-eui Yoon.

My research interests lie in video understanding, particularly
1. VLM for video understanding
2. Long-term video understanding
3. Data- and Label-efficient Learning - [\[2\]](#c2)
4. But not limited to - [\[1\]](#c1)
