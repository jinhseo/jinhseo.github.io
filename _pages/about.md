<!--Hello:wave:, I am a research intern at KIST, working on machine learning and computer vision.  -->
Hello:wave:, I study machine learning and computer vision.  

My research goal is to design machines to learn and understand the world like humans.  
<!--Research interest covers label-efficient approach, learning from noisy labels and 3D scene understanding.-->
It leads me to think about follow-up researches: 1. Data- and Label-efficient learning 2. Learning from noisy labels 3. Depth estimation and 3D scene understanding

<!--My research topics focus on visual recognition techniques with data- and label-efficient approach.
I am also interested in learning from noisy data and 3D object recognition for robotics.
It leads me to think about follow-up research directions: 1. Learning from noisy labels 2. Perceptual intelligence for robotics.-->

* Object Discovery via Contrastive Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Detection.  
**Jinhwan Seo**, Wonho Bae, Danica J. Sutherland, Junhyug Noh<sup>\*</sup>, Daijin Kim<sup>\*</sup>  
ECCV 2022 - [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07576.pdf) | [project page](https://jinhseo.github.io/research/wsod.html) | [code](https://github.com/jinhseo/OD-WSCL)  
<!--How can we find as many instances as possible in weakly supervised learning where we don't know how many instances in an image?  
We introduced a novel approach to find ignored pseudo groundtruths via _object discovery_ module guided by contrastive learning for weakly supervised object detection.  -->
