Hello, this is Jinhwan Seo pursuing master degree(Artificial Intelligence) at POSTECH. My research objectives are in computer vision and machine learning. I am primilarily interested in visual recognition techniques with less supervision, such as weakly supervised and semi-supervised learning. My future research topics brodaly include learning from noisy or limited data, and also application of perceptual intelligence on robotics.
